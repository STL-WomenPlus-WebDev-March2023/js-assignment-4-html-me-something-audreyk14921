              Audrey's Trip to Budapest: A Luggage Tale
          </h1>
          <h2>Lights Up!</h2>
          <h3>Setting: A small dorm room in Vienna.</h3>
              <p>
                  We can see Audrey, a young traveler living in Vienna for the summer. They are packing for a weekend trip to Budapest.<br>
                  They are sitting on the floor, next to a suitcase. Clothing is scattered across the floor. Excitement is shimmering in their eyes.
              </p>
              <p>
                  "I am going to travel to Budapest!" Audrey says, "It will be amazing, as I embark on a trip alone for the first time."<br>
                  "My bus leaves at six o' clock in the morning and it is--"<br>
                  <b>"Three AM!"---</b>
                  "I must pack faster! Better!"

                  "Finally! I am done packing, I can head to the bus station."

                  A scene change, possibly involving glitter and colorful lights.<br>

                Audrey is asleep on a bus, somewhere in the European countryside.

                  The bus abruptly stops, the bus driver bellows some commands in a foriegn language. <br>
                  Audrey awakes with a smile. They say, "Budapest! I arrived in one piece! Time to grab my luggage!"<br>
                  <b>&nbsp;As Audrey steps off the bus along with other travelers, they watch in horror as the bus drives away, without the bus driver helping anyone retrieve their luggage.</b><br>
                  <p>
                      "Whatever shall I do?!" Cried Audrey, almost in tears. "All of my possessions, including my glasses and medications, were in a duffel bag on that bus!"<br></p>
                <article>
                  A montage ensues, wherein Audrey goes to the front desk of the bus station, begs for help, and is yelled at by a mean Hungarian front desk worker. Audrey has lost almost all hope, until a young Hungarian girl appears; she is also missing her luggage. The girl cusses out the mean front desk worker in Hungarian, pulls out her phone, and begins to look for the bus that has left with their luggage. They find it.

                <h3>
                  A celebration! The girl and Audrey hug as they part ways. Audrey gets inside a taxi, on their way to their hostel. Audrey proceeds to have a lovely time in Budapest, with all of the supplies they packed in their luggage.
